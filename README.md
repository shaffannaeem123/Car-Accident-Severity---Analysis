The Car Accident Severity project aims to understand the effects of various factors on the likelihood and severity of car accidents using a Machine Learning Model.

# Introduction

Road traffic injuries are among the ten leading causes of death worldwide, and they are the leading cause of death among young adults aged 15–29 years. Such accidents also lead to 20–50 million non-fatal injuries, and many people incur a disability as a result of their injury. According to WHO, 1·25 million people worldwide died in road traffic accidents in 2013.  
The world also suffers greatly on an economic front due to road accidents and the costs of these accidents are covered by taxpayer money.  Among all countries, the USA has the largest economic burden of road injuries of $487 billion, followed by China ($364 billion) and India ($101 billion); according to a research journal published by THE LANCET.

# Major Stakeholders

1. Travelers
2. State Health Department
3. Emergency Services
4. Infrastructural Development Authorities
5. Families of the Travelers
6. Taxpayers

# Problem

There is a lack of awareness amongst travelers regarding the risks they might be facing while taking certain routes, crossing certain areas, driving at a specific speed, driving on a specific road, and being inattentive while driving, etc. High-accident-prone areas are seldom inspected with regards to road maintenance, and deployment of additional emergency services personnel, causing additional damage caused by road accidents.

# Goal

In this project, I aim to predict whether an accident that happens under a specific set of circumstances will be an accident limited to *property damage* or if it will include some form of *physical injury* to the driver and passengers.
